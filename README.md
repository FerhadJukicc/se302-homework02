# SE302 Homework 02 - Sweet Shop (Starter)

This is a **starter** Playwright + TypeScript project with Page Object Model (POM).

It includes:
- 2 working example tests (negative login + checkout required field validation)
- 3 TODO test stubs you must complete so you have 5 total tests.

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

## Run
```bash
npm test
```

## Where to edit
- `pom/` contains selectors + helper actions (edit selectors here if anything fails to locate)
- `tests/` contains specs. Complete the TODO specs by mapping to your manual test cases.
